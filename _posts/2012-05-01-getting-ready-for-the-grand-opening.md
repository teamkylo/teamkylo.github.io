### Countdown to Party Time
It feels a bit like preparing to host a big party. You do your best to clean house, set out placecards, and design a menu - all while fretting over the guest list and who might be bringing whom. Deciding to go open source with Kylo was easy, figuring out the how, where and when was a bit more involved. 

### Licensing
We ultimately chose to license Kylo under the [Mozilla Public License, version 2.0](http://www.mozilla.org/MPL), keeping with its ancestral lineage. The MPL is a great license for commercial and personal initiatives alike. The MPL is what allowed Hillcrest Labs to build Kylo in the first place; incorporating the Gecko SDK into our commercial product. In turn, we hope that licensing Kylo under the terms of the MPL will help other enthusiasts and professionals incorporate Kylo into their products. Distributing an un-modified version of Kylo with your own hardware or software is entirely covered and very simple. If you have questions or concerns about releasing modified versions of Kylo, please see our [trademark policy](http://code.kylo.tv/trademarks) or [contact us](mailto:kylotrademarks@kylo.tv).

### Github
[Github](http://github.com), arguably [the most popular open source forge][1], is now the new home for Kylo Browser source code. Github provided the features we were looking for (uptime, organizations and teams, and issue tracking), and some wonderful additional features we didn't yet know we wanted (wiki, organization pages, jekyll support). Getting all our resources together on Github has been a breeze and we think community developers will appreciate it as well!

### Join the Party
Want to get involved? Start by making your own copy of the code (Make sure you have an [account](http://github.com/plans) first), then take a look around, maybe try fixing a few [bugs](http://github.com/teamkylo/kylo-browser/issues), or start working on your own great ideas. Let us know when you've got something to show by submitting a pull request. Make sure to check out our [community forum](http://kylo.tv/community) to see what others have said about Kylo, or to discuss ideas and issues. 

All set? [Fork away](http://github.com/teamkylo/kylo-browser)!
